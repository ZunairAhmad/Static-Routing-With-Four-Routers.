we used a networking tool Packet Tracer which is a cross-platform visual simulation tool designed by Cisco Systems that allows users to create network topologies and imitate moderncomputer networks. The software allows users to simulate the
configuration of Cisco routers and switches using a simulated command line interface.
with the help of Packet Tracer we performed the following tasks:
Observing Static Routing With Four Routers
Observing Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol With 3-Different VLANs
